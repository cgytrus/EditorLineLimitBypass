# Editor Line Limit Bypass
A Geometry Dash mod that increases the maximum amount of lines the editor can render

if you're using MHv7 you can configure the limit in the extension's menu
 - default vanilla is 200
 - default with the mod is 8388608

### **! WARNING !**
using this will increase your ram usage in the editor by almost 128 MiB because of the way line rendering is setup
